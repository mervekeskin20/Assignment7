## Results

Our algorithm provides new insights into well and poor performing algorithms that are not available with accuracy or other bin-by-bin metrics.

## Conclusion

Our work complements existing approaches to define domain specific cost functions. In the future we plan to incorporate quantum computing to speed up inference over multiple flows.
